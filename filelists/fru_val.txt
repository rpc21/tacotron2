/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M040.wav|No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M025.wav|I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F033.wav|...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M012.wav|All right.  All right, just listen.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M037.wav|No, I just showed that for you [garbage].
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M017.wav|Of course not.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F039.wav|And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M000.wav|Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F026.wav|I expect it's because you're drunk.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M015.wav|Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M030.wav|I've tried.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F019.wav|No, three days, sir.  It's not three days. It's- It's only been about a day now. Let's not exaggerate.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M017.wav|Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F029.wav|Do shut up. Shut up.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_M007.wav|You don't know! you can't write?  You don't know how to write?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_F008.wav|It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_F026.wav|Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_F028.wav|Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M024.wav|Do you want me to get some champagne?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F008.wav|I'm bored of this conversation.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro01/Ses01M_impro01_F004.wav|What are you... what's...What are you applying for?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F021.wav|They sting.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M016.wav|Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_F031.wav|I work out of my home as a realtor and because I don't have a land line, I need a phone and because of now I don't have one I don't know what to do.  And you're not helping me at all.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08b/Ses03M_impro08b_F012.wav|I don't know even how to use that stuff it's too complicated.  I just want my flip phone to work----that's all I need
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M012.wav|I got to.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_F010.wav|Well you better.  You better give me a whole freaking new phone that's what you better do.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M020.wav|I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_F011.wav|You can waist as much as you want
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M030.wav|I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F012.wav|You can't tell him that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M018.wav|No, it's been--three days.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M024.wav|I am the supervisor.  So--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M043.wav|No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M022.wav|No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_F037.wav|Turn it on again, please.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_M002.wav|um and everything was pretty much uh- uh- just not done right. All the orders were messed up.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05b/Ses03M_impro05b_M005.wav|Now what are you going to do for me different? Hmm?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M003.wav|It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M016.wav|Nothing.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F010.wav|But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F011.wav|And I can give you my social--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F013.wav|That's my point.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F019.wav|Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M024.wav|You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F020.wav|That's the wind.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M034.wav|Well, I'm doing the best I can.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_F018.wav|Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M019.wav|Come on, you know that's not only my business.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_F017.wav|How long does that take?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F037.wav|I mean, anything.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M005.wav|Listen, kid-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_F021.wav|Yeah, I- I make my
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M008.wav|I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_2/Ses04M_script01_2_M013.wav|But, Kate--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F014.wav|Law school? Maybe.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro02/Ses04F_impro02_F016.wav|I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M017.wav|This is unbelievable. I've got
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_2/Ses02M_script01_2_M002.wav|What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F011.wav|No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M031.wav|All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F030.wav|No.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M012.wav|I go in for these interviews, and they're all cool and everything, you know.  Their nice and I'm nice to them, you know, give and take, back and forth, and whatever.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_F013.wav|To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M037.wav|It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F012.wav|For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M005.wav|Okay, now listen, kids...
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro01/Ses01M_impro01_M027.wav|I did not come in here to get in a yelling match with you, all right?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M023.wav|She's not Larry's girl.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M006.wav|Well then what's bugging you?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_F007.wav|Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M029.wav|Because it is.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M017.wav|Why not?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05a/Ses03M_impro05a_F010.wav|No.  I'm just going to check--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F029.wav|There's other people waiting-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_M008.wav|or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_F028.wav|Well obviously it's not working.  Just cause you got sixteen hundred on your S.A.T. doesn't guarantee you a job.  I mean it should really but--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_M012.wav|You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M013.wav|No, of course, not.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_F009.wav|Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F013.wav|I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M010.wav|I'm not choosing. I'm not-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_F010.wav|I don't-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_F003.wav|It's ours; it's mine too.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_M000.wav|Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M001.wav|Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_M023.wav|Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F003.wav|So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M015.wav|I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F034.wav|Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_F002.wav|Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_M020.wav|I mean, some information here would be great.  Some help.  Can you, like, type something in and find out?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_M014.wav|It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F024.wav|And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M016.wav|No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_F014.wav|And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M014.wav|All right, all right.  Calm yourself.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_F011.wav|I have been waiting for over an hour.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M014.wav|Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F042.wav|All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M003.wav|How do you know he is even thinking about it?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_M006.wav|I guess they can do it,
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F032.wav|No.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_F014.wav|What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M027.wav|What?  What do you want a divorce?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_M023.wav|I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M019.wav|Fine, it's been a day.  Okay?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_M006.wav|Okay, so what are you saying? What-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M012.wav|-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M029.wav|Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?
