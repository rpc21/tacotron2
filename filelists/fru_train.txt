/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M030.wav|All right then, mom.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M018.wav|You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M027.wav|Yes they do.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M029.wav|No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_2/Ses01F_script01_2_F014.wav|I can't help it.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M039.wav|Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M006.wav|And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M027.wav|Because it is.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_M020.wav|and I'll tell her how you've been behaving.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F017.wav|No no, we're not taking anything from you sir.  This is- This is unbeknownst to us.  The problem had just happened.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M010.wav|I can't.

How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F000.wav|Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F021.wav|I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_F025.wav|I don't know.  Baby, why are you asking me this?  It's just as hard for me.  Please, try to understand that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M031.wav|Look, I--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_F024.wav|Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_M027.wav|So, go to McDonalds.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M026.wav|That's what the cost of the ticket was for.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_M020.wav|Do you want my jacket?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M015.wav|It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F027.wav|No.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_M016.wav|Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F038.wav|No, I don't want a diagram.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M026.wav|So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M038.wav|I like to think so.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_M005.wav|There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F002.wav|I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F030.wav|And your bag is not my concern.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_F032.wav|In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M005.wav|I thought you wanted to see it.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_2/Ses01F_script01_2_M014.wav|Okay. Calm yourself.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M041.wav|But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M023.wav|They snap.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_F015.wav|I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_F014.wav|What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M001.wav|What I was just saying.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M025.wav|Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M029.wav|I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M029.wav|Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_F002.wav|Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F021.wav|Yeah.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M008.wav|Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_F013.wav|Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F035.wav|I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_F006.wav|Excuse me sir?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_M012.wav|Well, no one even told me about that.  Like, why would I think to buy insurance?  I was- It's like a three hour flight.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F011.wav|I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F017.wav|Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_F005.wav|Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro01/Ses01M_impro01_M028.wav|Just try and help me.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_M042.wav|Then help me stay here.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F022.wav|Well I'm just saying--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M029.wav|Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F022.wav|I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F028.wav|We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F024.wav|Now what can I do for you?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_M008.wav|Why not?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_F018.wav|Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M024.wav|A vacation?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M020.wav|No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F023.wav|You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_M008.wav|There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F013.wav|Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M003.wav|Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M024.wav|that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F004.wav|So I'll have to wait twenty five years-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F013.wav|We can't. It just won't work.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M010.wav|I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M005.wav|I can't do that.  I have to go.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M019.wav|You know that's not just my business.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F011.wav|and it was like something like eight hundred dollars. I don't remember. It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now, but-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_M010.wav|This will take like a minute, okay? Jesus.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_M026.wav|I'm sorry she's--these people they just want to get their license--

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F017.wav|Why?  It's a piece of paper.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_F040.wav|I don't understand you, do I?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M014.wav|Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_M015.wav|I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M018.wav|Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M014.wav|You know what, this is your fault.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M019.wav|So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_2/Ses04M_script01_2_M017.wav|Why me above all?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_F036.wav|You're smart.  You could go back to school--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_M017.wav|Yeah.  I mean, if you have a suggestion, like, it would be great to help me out here.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_M009.wav|Like it's really hard to like shake that off when you go into like audition a room or whatever, you know what I mean?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_F002.wav|No, they told me-I'm sorry, but they told me to be in this line.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro05/Ses03F_impro05_F004.wav|Well, that's what I'm asking you. What--I don't know what happened to it.

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M031.wav|Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F029.wav|But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.
