/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M008.wav|I love you. Annie, I love you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F028.wav|and we'll explore and you going to have such a good time, you're going to fit in so well, it's going to be awesome
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M036.wav|Oh, well look what we've got here.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F024.wav|Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M043.wav|So what do you think?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F014.wav|I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M038.wav|Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M041.wav|We were very much younger then.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F025.wav|She said sure?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F011.wav|Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F011.wav|[LAUGHTER]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M008.wav|What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M021.wav|We are figures of fun all right
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F012.wav|I almost got married two years ago.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_F011.wav|Oh, you did not just say that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M000.wav|I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F002.wav|Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M013.wav|I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F017.wav|Yeah. It's really cool.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M013.wav|Yeah.  And she said yes.  And she cried, of course.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F017.wav|Yeah,I'll hang out with the both of you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_F009.wav|I guess this is why I came.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F003.wav|No.  But I'm not going to stay.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F015.wav|Oh, totally totally.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_1/Ses02M_script03_1_F028.wav|Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_M025.wav|And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F037.wav|Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_M008.wav|Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F011.wav|Well,
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F050.wav|Maybe this is the right place after all.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M039.wav|Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F034.wav|Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F012.wav|[LAUGHTER]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F048.wav|At least we won't need glasses.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro07/Ses03M_impro07_F000.wav|Hey.  How's it going?  I haven't seen you in awhile.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F041.wav|[BREATHING]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M010.wav|Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M017.wav|Give me a kiss.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M062.wav|Oh thanks, you're too nice
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_F020.wav|No. No plans. or any- and probably
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M016.wav|Give me a...
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro03/Ses01F_impro03_M014.wav|Is that your phone?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M016.wav|Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F007.wav|Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F021.wav|Not like that you're not.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_M001.wav|She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_F003.wav|No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M017.wav|Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_F013.wav|Every day since.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M022.wav|Ahh...who knows.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F025.wav|Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F022.wav|Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_M021.wav|Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F034.wav|Yeah, she-yeah, that's my type.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F018.wav|How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M031.wav|Hah.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M018.wav|Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F024.wav|I will do the best I can.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes, meaning just that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_M019.wav|I kissed you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_1/Ses02M_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always sweet.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F034.wav|Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro06/Ses04F_impro06_F009.wav|And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_M011.wav|So, I mean--it's good though.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro03/Ses01F_impro03_F024.wav|Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F017.wav|Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F029.wav|What'll I do with a fortune?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M040.wav|oh...
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M068.wav|That'd be great, thanks.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F033.wav|Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_M004.wav|That is great.  You look radiant.  I should've guess.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M008.wav|and you can climb it and it's covered in algae you know. So, I wanted her to climb it to go take a picture, like, back in this little waterfall area, and she got back there and she took her picture. And then, I had her come back.  And I was going to do the same thing.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F021.wav|Oh, my gosh.  You told your parents already? and everything
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro07/Ses01M_impro07_M033.wav|Pull over..
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F013.wav|You started to write me and--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F020.wav|I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F019.wav|Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_M030.wav|Oh, alright.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M041.wav|It's not champagne.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F000.wav|And very much sillier.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro07/Ses03M_impro07_M014.wav|Yeah.  This is so crazy.  I mean I didn't get into any other school but I got into the school I wanted.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M024.wav|Of course.  I told them right away.  We called them all right them.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M006.wav|I did it up at Yosemite.  We went camping right like we usually do.  You know we go camping up there all the time.  But, um- the waterfalls had died down a little bit, you know. And so uh- we-I had her climb up.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M000.wav|I know, it went out of style, didn't it?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F029.wav|She'll be like--flowers and the--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F036.wav|The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M021.wav|Give me-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_M028.wav|All right.  Bye, bye.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M012.wav|Ah...Strange...
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M057.wav|yeah.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F035.wav|What would I do with a fortune?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F004.wav|It had to happen sooner or later.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_1/Ses02M_script03_1_F022.wav|Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_M020.wav|Yeah, I'd love to be in that same situation some day, but, wow- so-
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F020.wav|Okay. They have a lot of good schools, right?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F051.wav|Two artists, though.  We're bound to be poor forever.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes.  Meaning just that.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F017.wav|Yeah, yeah, I called them. I called them And, of course, they were so excited 'cause they love him. Like they always have.  Um--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M046.wav|Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F016.wav|...and, um, my parents want to like be part of it and help out and everything--So we want to give it lots of time to like--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F027.wav|What'll I do with a fortune?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M049.wav|So I was one of the first ones? That makes me feel so important.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F053.wav|Definitely not for a while
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_M012.wav|Sara and I--
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F013.wav|So where are you going to have your wedding?

/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M027.wav|Of course, we're gonna have kids, like three at least.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M034.wav|Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_F024.wav|This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F012.wav|She actually asked if it was real?  I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_F015.wav|Oh, yeah. Everyone--yeah. And people--friends of ours were in the audience, I didn't know about, like family members.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F045.wav|Or not.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F001.wav|Uh-, So I got some good news.
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M016.wav|We're going to do it back in the Midwest where her family all is.  They're all out there. you know so, Um  And so, just gonna have a small, small wedding. But, um- you know, of course, you're going to come, right?
/scratch/speech/datasets/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F026.wav|Yeah, it's pretty good.
